    <h1>Exploratory Data Analysis</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
        This section of the analysis focuses on preprocessing the dataset by detecting and handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers. We will begin by addressing missing values through appropriate imputation techniques and remove or adjust duplicates to ensure data integrity. Next, we'll identify and treat outliers to avoid skewed results. The visualization phase will include key graphics, such as pair plots for correlation analysis, scatter plots for relationships between variables, and histograms to explore distributions. Finally, we will conduct descriptive statistics and split the data into training and testing sets, setting up a robust foundation for further modeling and analysis.
